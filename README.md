Backend driven UI App. Getting blocks and order list named "view" from API. I made a universal solution where UI depends on view list.
Every block is a tableView cell, API can be edited and app will adapt UI for new order. Also i made a selector cell which can parse 
more than 3 variants. By clicking on blocks user can see the alert with block name.
